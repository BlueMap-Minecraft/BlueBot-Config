BlueMap only renders parts of the world that are already generated by minecraft. So usually only areas that a player has visited ingame.
If you want to see more on BlueMap, you'll need to pre-generate the part of your world that you want to see on the map. 
You can do this with a pre-generation plugin like e.g. Chunky: <https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky/wiki/Installing>
