BlueMap's latest versions don't support Minecraft 1.12.2 anymore. Even older Minecraft versions were never supported.  
The last version that supported 1.12.2 was [BlueMap v1.5.5](<https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap/releases/tag/v1.5.5>).

This version is **extremely old**, it released **<t:1624633260:R>**!  
Mod support is really difficult and tedious to configure and you most likely won't get much help with it since we all simply forgot how it worked :D

**In short: Don't use it!**  
Consider upgrading your world instead.

If you still decide to give it a try, here are some resources and basic information:
- Only Spigot, SpongeForge, and the BlueMap CLI are supported for 1.12.2. If you have a modded Forge server, you will need to use SpongeForge to load BlueMap
- Double-check that your modpack doesn't include one of the [incompatible mods](<https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMapWiki/blob/9ffe114fae2bef3cf4eec8b3e0567d7b45a3ab82/wiki/FAQ.md#known-incompatibilities-with-other-mods>)
- Here's [an old version of the BlueMap Wiki page](<https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMapWiki/blob/9ffe114fae2bef3cf4eec8b3e0567d7b45a3ab82/wiki/customization/Mods.md#configuring-mods>) about mods with some rough info on how to get them rendering properly in 1.5.5
