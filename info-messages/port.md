description: "Maybe your port is not open?"
everyone: true

To host your BlueMap you need a **additional** open port, next to the one that Minecraft is using!

**On most Minecraft server hosts:** You can open an additional port somewhere in your hosts dashboard, or you need to ask the support of your host *if* and *how* you can open a additional port.

**If you are hosting the server yourself:** In your own network, you need to forward the port for BlueMap the same way you forwarded the port for your Minecraft server on your router! :)
