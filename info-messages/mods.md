BlueMap is automatically looking for mods and datapacks in your server-files. If it finds them it will try to load them and parse its resources to be able to render any additional blocks.

BlueMap might not be able to parse all blocks and resources for a mod. For example, if a mod generates its resources/block-models at runtime, BlueMap wonâ€™t be able to find them in the `mod.jar` and will not be able to render them correctly! You might still be able to fix this by creating a resource pack for the models.
