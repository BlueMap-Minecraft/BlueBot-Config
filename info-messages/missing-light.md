description: Info about chunks missing light-data

By default, BlueMap renders all chunks that have been fully generated by Minecraft.  
If you see black spots on your map but you are sure that the chunks there should be generated, then those chunks might have missing light-data.

Please run this command: `/bluemap troubleshoot <map> <x> <z>` with the x/z coordinates of such a black spot on your map.  
If that command returns something like:
```
⚠ chunks are missing light-data [...]
```
then that is the case and you should follow [this guide](<https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/community/FixLighting.html>) to generate the light-data for your chunks and fix the problem :)
