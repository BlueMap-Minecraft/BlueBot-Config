BlueMap's integrated web-server does not support SSL/HTTPS, however you can use an external web-server with those capabilities and reverse-proxy BlueMap's webserver.

Here are examples on how to do that with some external web-servers: <https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/wiki/webserver/ReverseProxy.html>
