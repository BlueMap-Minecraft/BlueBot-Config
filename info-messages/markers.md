BlueMap allows you to add various markers to your map. You can do this either by manually configuring them in your map-config, which is explained how to do [here](<https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/wiki/customization/Markers.html>).

Or you can install a 3rd-party plugin that uses [BlueMap’s API](<https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMapAPI>) to manage markers for you.  
A [list of known 3rd-party plugins](<https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/community/3rdPartySupport.html>) that use BlueMap’s API is available on the wiki.
