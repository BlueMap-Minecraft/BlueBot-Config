BlueMap needs to wait until the server saves the world data to disk, so it may take some time for changes to appear on the map.
For more detail on how BlueMap detects changes, please read this: https://discord.com/channels/665868367416131594/751804128749027421/1113584444499054642

Also make sure to click Update Map in BlueMap's menu to make your browser fetch a fresh copy of the updated map-tiles.
