description: Explains the difference between BlueMap's Spigot and Paper versions
everyone: true

For Bukkit-based servers, BlueMap is available as both a Spigot plugin and a Paper plugin.

The Spigot version uses the Spigot-API, while the Paper version uses the extended Paper-API.
There are minor differences, mostly in how commands are registered and work, but mostly it's just a compatibility thing: e.g. the Paper version supports Folia, while the Spigot version doesn't.
But the Spigot version works for older Minecraft versions, while the Paper version only supports 1.20.1 and up.

If you're running a Paper server of a supported version, it is recommended to get the Paper version of BlueMap. Otherwise, get the Spigot version.
