BlueMap **does not support** Bedrock Edition.

*However*, using some manual labour, it may be possible to see your Bedrock Edition world in BlueMap anyway!

1. Convert your Bedrock Edition world to a Java Edition world using a tool. (Some options you could look into are [Chunker](<https://www.chunker.app/>) and [je2be](<https://je2be.app/>), but more may exist)
2. Download the [BlueMap CLI](<https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/wiki/getting-started/Installation.html#using-bluemap-on-the-cli--standalone>) (an unofficial [GUI wrapper](<https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapGUI>) is also available)
3. Configure the BlueMap CLI/GUI to point to where you stored the converted Java Edition world files
4. Run it, and open your map

Your mileage may vary...
