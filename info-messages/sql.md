There is basically no performance, speed, or storage-space advantage in using SQL over normal files.
Whether you need it or not depends on your desired setup. You should only use it if you need the features it provides that normal file storage doesn't provide.
Here are some advantages and disadvantages of SQL to help guide you into making the right decision _for you_

**Advantages:**
- It doesn't make thousands of files
- It can be saved on another machine (though you can do that with files too, by mounting a network drive)
- It's more convenient when combining maps from multiple separate servers into a single BlueMap webapp

**Disadvantages:**
- It requires more set-up work. (Especially if you've never used SQL before, it could be very challenging)
- If the connection to your database is bad, it could actually be slower than normal file storage
