If you **always** want to hide **all** players, you can disable player markers in `plugin.conf`, with the `live-player-markers` option.

But if you want _more control_ over **who** is hidden and **when** (and who can hide who), then you have to use an addon:
- **Paper:** <https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapPlayerControl>
- **Fabric:** <https://modrinth.com/plugin/bmarker> (This one is mainly meant for creating new markers and editing them through commands, but it also has player marker controls as a "side-feature")
- **Other platforms:** Sadly there are no addons for other platforms yet, that we know of...
