description: Storage comparison to dynmap
everyone: true

Dynmap's maps are saved in a completely different way than BlueMap's maps. This makes it really hard to compare the storage-footprints.

Depending on settings like Dynmap's render-quality, map types and number of different renders for a world, the space-comparison can vary a lot in both directions.

It would be an unfair comparison, to compare a fully 3D BlueMap render where all sides of a block can been seen, to a single Isometric view in Dynmap, as BlueMap would take more space.
Likewise Dynmap with multiple renders to be able to view all sides of all blocks would take up far more space than BlueMap does.

Generally speaking a single 2D render and Isometric render in Dynmap at normal quality levels, will use similar space as BlueMap, but can still differ considerably either way.
