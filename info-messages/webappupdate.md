To update the BlueMap webapp, delete the `index.html` file in your webroot (usually at `/bluemap/web/index.html`) 
Then run the command `/bluemap reload` on your server

In every update's changelog, Blue writes instructions on how to upgrade from the previous version
Usually that's just swapping the jar files, like normal, but sometimes there is more that you need to do
Often that includes doing this.
So make sure to check the update instructions for every update :)
