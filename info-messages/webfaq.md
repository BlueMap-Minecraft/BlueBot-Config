### Where can I open my map?
By default, it's your servers public ip-address (e.g. `123.45.67.8`) and the port (`8100`) like this: `http://123.45.67.8:8100/`
*(Make sure you replace `123.45.67.8` with **your** server-ip. The same ip that you are using to connect to your minecraft-server!)*
### I still can't access the website!
Here is a checklist:
- Do you get a message saying `Webserver started...` in your server-console/log? If not, look if there are any
  errors/warnings and check the configuration again.
- Make sure you are using `http` and not `https` when connecting to the webpage.
- Is the port (`8100` by default) open and forwarded correctly? Or is your firewall blocking incoming connections 
  on the port? If you don't know this **ask your server-host how you can open a second port for BlueMap!**
### If you still have problems accessing your map after that, please tell us:
- how / on which host you are hosting your server?
- what exactly you have tried so far?
