description: Explains how to use BlueMap on single-player

BlueMap was created specifically for servers.
Using BlueMap **as a mod** on single-player clients is very tricky, and *not officially supported*.

**However**, BlueMap is also available as a separate program that runs completely detached from your game.
This program _does_ officially support single-player worlds, but it is a ***command-line (CLI)*** program.
Here is a guide on how to set it up:

If you don't know what "command-line program" means, or if you're not comfortable with them, or just don't want to deal with them, a community member has created a graphical (GUI) program that makes it super simple to use BlueMap on single-player worlds:

If you would like some help with this program, you can ping `@TechnicJelle` in <#863844716047106068> with your question :)
