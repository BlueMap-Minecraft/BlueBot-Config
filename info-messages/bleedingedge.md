If you accept a potentially unstable experience (even more unstable than snapshots or pre-releases), then you can try using the latest development build of BlueMap:
1. Make sure you have a GitHub account and are logged in
2. Then you can go to this link: <https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush+is%3Asuccess>
3. Open the newest successful Build workflow run (Click the top one that has a âœ… next to it)
4. Then scroll down until you see "artifacts"
5. Download it to get a zip full of BlueMap jars
6. Extract the one for your platform, and use that instead of the version you're using right now
