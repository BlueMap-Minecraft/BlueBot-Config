BlueMap doesn't add support for plugins/mods.
It works the other way around, instead: other plugins/mods can add support for BlueMap!

BlueMap has a really nice API that developers can use to integrate into BlueMap: <https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMapAPI/wiki>

Or if the other plugin also has an API, any developer can write a "bridge-plugin" that acts as a bridge between BlueMap and the other plugin :)

You can find all known plugins and mods that support BlueMap here: <https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/community/3rdPartySupport.html>
