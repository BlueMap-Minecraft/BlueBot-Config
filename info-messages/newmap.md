**How to make BlueMap generate map configs (again):**

1. Shut down your server.
2. Rename the `bluemap/maps/` folder (the one with the .conf files in it) to `maps.bak`.
3. Start your server.
4. Stop your server.
5. The maps folder should be regenerated now, with new, fresh config files in it, so go into it.
6. Edit the new configs to your liking, using the backup you made previously in `maps.bak` as reference.
